       "<p>The <em>Chief Historian</em> is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.</p> \n",
       "<p>As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a <em class=\"star\">star</em>. They figure the Chief Historian <em>must</em> be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get <em class=\"star\">fifty stars</em> on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.</p> \n",
       "<p>Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants <em class=\"star\">one star</em>. Good luck!</p> \n",
       "<p>You haven't even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior Historians has already hit a problem: their list of locations to check is currently <em>empty</em>. Eventually, someone decides that the best place to check first would be the Chief Historian's office.</p> \n",
       "<p>Upon pouring into the office, everyone confirms that the Chief Historian is indeed nowhere to be found. Instead, the Elves discover an assortment of notes and lists of historically significant locations! This seems to be the planning the Chief Historian was doing before he left. Perhaps these notes can be used to determine which locations to search?</p> \n",
       "<p>Throughout the Chief's office, the historically significant locations are listed not by name but by a unique number called the <em>location ID</em>. To make sure they don't miss anything, The Historians split into two groups, each searching the office and trying to create their own complete list of location IDs.</p> \n",
       "<p>There's just one problem: by holding the two lists up <em>side by side</em> (your puzzle input), it quickly becomes clear that the lists aren't very similar. Maybe you can help The Historians reconcile their lists?</p> \n",
       "<p>For example:</p> \n",
       "<pre><code>3   4\n",
       "4   3\n",
       "2   5\n",
       "1   3\n",
       "3   9\n",
       "3   3\n",
       "</code></pre> \n",
       "<p>Maybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the <em>smallest number in the left list</em> with the <em>smallest number in the right list</em>, then the <em>second-smallest left number</em> with the <em>second-smallest right number</em>, and so on.</p> \n",
       "<p>Within each pair, figure out <em>how far apart</em> the two numbers are; you'll need to <em>add up all of those distances</em>. For example, if you pair up a <code>3</code> from the left list with a <code>7</code> from the right list, the distance apart is <code>4</code>; if you pair up a <code>9</code> with a <code>3</code>, the distance apart is <code>6</code>.</p> \n",
       "<p>In the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:</p> \n",
       "<ul> \n",
       " <li>The smallest number in the left list is <code>1</code>, and the smallest number in the right list is <code>3</code>. The distance between them is <code><em>2</em></code>.</li> \n",
       " <li>The second-smallest number in the left list is <code>2</code>, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another <code>3</code>. The distance between them is <code><em>1</em></code>.</li> \n",
       " <li>The third-smallest number in both lists is <code>3</code>, so the distance between them is <code><em>0</em></code>.</li> \n",
       " <li>The next numbers to pair up are <code>3</code> and <code>4</code>, a distance of <code><em>1</em></code>.</li> \n",
       " <li>The fifth-smallest numbers in each list are <code>3</code> and <code>5</code>, a distance of <code><em>2</em></code>.</li> \n",
       " <li>Finally, the largest number in the left list is <code>4</code>, while the largest number in the right list is <code>9</code>; these are a distance <code><em>5</em></code> apart.</li> \n",
       "</ul> \n",
       "<p>To find the <em>total distance</em> between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is <code>2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5</code>, a total distance of <code><em>11</em></code>!</p> \n",
       "<p>Your actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. <em>What is the total distance between your lists?</em></p>"

       "<p>You all arrive at a <a href=\"/2023/day/15\">Lava Production Facility</a> on a floating island in the sky. As the others begin to search the massive industrial complex, you feel a small nose boop your leg and look down to discover a <span title=\"i knew you would come back\">reindeer</span> wearing a hard hat.</p> \n",
       "<p>The reindeer is holding a book titled \"Lava Island Hiking Guide\". However, when you open the book, you discover that most of it seems to have been scorched by lava! As you're about to ask how you can help, the reindeer brings you a blank <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_map\" target=\"_blank\">topographic map</a> of the surrounding area (your puzzle input) and looks up at you excitedly.</p> \n",
       "<p>Perhaps you can help fill in the missing hiking trails?</p> \n",
       "<p>The topographic map indicates the <em>height</em> at each position using a scale from <code>0</code> (lowest) to <code>9</code> (highest). For example:</p> \n",

       "<p>Based on un-scorched scraps of the book, you determine that a good hiking trail is <em>as long as possible</em> and has an <em>even, gradual, uphill slope</em>. For all practical purposes, this means that a <em>hiking trail</em> is any path that starts at height <code>0</code>, ends at height <code>9</code>, and always increases by a height of exactly 1 at each step. Hiking trails never include diagonal steps - only up, down, left, or right (from the perspective of the map).</p> \n",
       "<p>You look up from the map and notice that the reindeer has helpfully begun to construct a small pile of pencils, markers, rulers, compasses, stickers, and other equipment you might need to update the map with hiking trails.</p> \n",
       "<p>A <em>trailhead</em> is any position that starts one or more hiking trails - here, these positions will always have height <code>0</code>. Assembling more fragments of pages, you establish that a trailhead's <em>score</em> is the number of <code>9</code>-height positions reachable from that trailhead via a hiking trail. In the above example, the single trailhead in the top left corner has a score of <code>1</code> because it can reach a single <code>9</code> (the one in the bottom left).</p> \n",
